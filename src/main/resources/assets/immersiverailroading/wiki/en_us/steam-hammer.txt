[prefix{l}] Overview[prefix{}]

The Steam Hammer is used to process some parts before they are placed onto a Frame. It is the smallest machine in Immersive Railroading, requiring a mere 5 blocks in width, 1 in depth, and 6 in height.

It is built from:
*  3 x Heavy Engineering Block
*  1 x Piston
* 10 x Light Engineering Block

Operating the Steam Hammer requires power, which is input through the top block. To operate the hammer, right-click the central block to open the GUI. Place the item that should be processed in the left slot, and after a few moments it will move to the right slot, which means it is now ready for use.
