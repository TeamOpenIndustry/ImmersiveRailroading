## FUEL
Firstly, a diesel locomotive needs fuel. If you have [Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering) installed, you can use Ethanol and BioDiesel. If you have Immersive Petroleum installed as well, diesel fuel works too. Furthermore, most mods that add fluid containers for "kerosene", "gasoline", or "oil" will work too.

**Need rewrite: To in game config**

If you don't have any of these mods installed, you can add minecraft lava as a fuel. To do this, navigate to your minecraft profile directory. (Easiest way is to open the resource packs menu, click "Open Resource Pack Folder", then navigate up one directory) Inside the profile directory, is a folder called config; open this. Inside here is a file called "immersiverailroading.cfg" Edit this with a text editor. Find a part of the config that looks like this:

Add a line that says: "I:lava=200" then save the file and restart Minecraft.

Another alternative is to set fuelRequired to "false" in "immersiverailroading.cfg" or via the config menu. (numpad /)

## DRIVING
Before driving the locomotive, you need to fuel it. while riding it, right-click and a window pops up. Put your fuel container in the left slot and you'll see the tank fill up. You can also load the fuel using a [Fluid Loader Augment.](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/augment_fluid.md) Then, you need to turn it on using the On/Off control. Once it's running, the temperature will start rising, the throttle will be limited until it's warm, but trying to increase throttle will help it warm-up faster. Once the temperature is over 76Â°C, the loco should be able to start moving. Use the "Brakes Neutral" control to unlock the brakes. To avoid wheel-slip, gradually increase the throttle and let the loco accelerate. 

## TIPS
* To regulate speeds, use a combination of brake and throttle so that the loco doesn't accelerate or decelerate. When driving a fast or heavy train, you won't be able to stop very quickly. Plan ahead for stops and start slowing down well in advance.
* The longer the throttle is at a high level, the faster the temperature will rise. If the temperature bar goes red, then the loco will shut down until it cools-off to normal temperature.
