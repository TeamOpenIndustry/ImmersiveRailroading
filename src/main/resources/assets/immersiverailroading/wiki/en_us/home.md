[Immersive Railroading](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-railroading) is a Minecraft mod for 1.16, 1.15, 1.14, 1.12, 1.11, 1.10, and 1.7. IR depends on [Universal Mod Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-mod-core) and [Track API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/track-api), so you'll need those mods as well.

It adds a new transport system (item, fluids, players, animals, villagers) to the game. It is based on real world physics (where possible) and uses life size models to convey the true scale and grandeur of Railroading.
