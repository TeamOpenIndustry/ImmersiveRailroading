[Immersive Railroading](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-railroading) is a Minecraft mod for 1.16, 1.15, 1.14, 1.12, 1.11, 1.10, and 1.7. IR depends on [Universal Mod Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-mod-core) and [Track API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/track-api), so you'll need those mods as well.

It adds a new transport system (item, fluids, players, animals, villagers) to the game. It is based on real world physics (where possible) and uses life-size models to convey the true scale and grandeur of Railroading.
