## Overview

The Conductor's whistle is used to make villagers mount the nearest train to the player.  It affects villagers in a 50 block radius (configurable).

Right\-click with the whistle causes the villagers to board passenger cars (up to the max number allowed in the car).

Shift \+ right\-click with the whistle causes the villagers to disembark from the passenger cars.

Villagers will pay you 1 emerald for each kilometer traveled (1000 blocks).  This is calculated as the crow flies, if you just take them in a circle there will be no reward.
