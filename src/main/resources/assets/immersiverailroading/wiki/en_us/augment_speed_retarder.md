The Speed Retarder Augment is used to slow down locomotives/stock which are passing overhead.  Right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. Like any augment, it may be removed from the track by right-clicking with the wrench.

The brake force is proportional to the number of augments side by side and the redstone signal given.
