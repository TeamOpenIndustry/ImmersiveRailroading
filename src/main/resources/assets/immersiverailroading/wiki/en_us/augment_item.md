The Item Loader/Unloader Augments are used to interface with the inventory of the locomotive or stock which is overhead.  Right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. Like any augment, it may be removed from the track by right-clicking with the wrench.  It can be filtered by right-clicking on the augment with a locomotive or rolling stock item.

The item augments do not pull from adjacent inventories, nor do they push to adjacent inventories.
