The Track Roller is used to create track pieces for use with Track Blueprints.

The Track Roller requires a clear, level space that is 30 blocks deep, 2 blocks wide, and 3 blocks tall. When placed, the short side will be facing the player, and offset 1 block to the right. After placing, right-click with a Large Wrench anywhere on the arrangement of blocks to assemble the machine.

It is built from:
* 24 x Stone Slab
*  4 x Heavy Engineering Block
*  8 x Light Engineering Block

The Track Roller requires power to operate, which can be input at the top of the multiblock via any RF/IF-compatible method of power transfer. To create track sections, make a Rail Casting in the [link{immersiverailroading:casting-basin}]Casting Basin[link{}] and, with the casting in hand, right-click the Track Roller. After the animation completes, right-click the multiblock to receive 10 track segments in a given gauge.

These Track Segments are used with the [link{immersiverailroading:track-blueprint}]Track Blueprint[link{}] to lay down sections of track.
