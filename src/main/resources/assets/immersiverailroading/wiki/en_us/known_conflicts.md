Certain Mods / Configurations are known to cause conflicts

## Bungee/Waterfall:

You will need to change a Waterfall config option relating to entity IDs across servers.  See [GitHub issue#579](https://github.com/cam72cam/ImmersiveRailroading/issues/579) and [GitHub issue#136](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall/issues/136) for more details.

## ViveCraft

Since ViveCraft messes with the minecraft graphics internals, a lot of the functionality is known to break in unexpected ways.

## Oculus

Don't support for now, use OptiFine instead.
