Before establishing a railroad empire, it's a good idea to ensure a robust supply of Steel, Treated Wood, and electrical power.

When ready, create a [Blueprint Book](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/blueprint_book.md), a [Large Wrench](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/large_wrench.md), and a [Track Blueprint](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/track_blueprint.md). These three tools are essential to progress and construction through the mod.

Setting up a clear, level space at least 2 chunks by 2 chunks is recommended.  This will provide enough space for constructing machinery and rolling stock. The first machines you will need are the [Casting Basin](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/casting_basin.md) and [Track Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/track_roller.md) to create tracks. Making tracks requires a Rail Casting, which is made in the Casting Basin.

Next, place down at least 20 blocks of track end-to-end to have enough space to place a Frame on the rails, which is created in the Casting Basin. Make sure your Frame and Track gauges match up! With the Frame in hand, right-click the rail to place it. Then, with the Large Wrench in hand, right-click the Frame. It will list the parts needed to complete the piece of stock and which machines are needed in order to make those parts. For example, a newly placed A1 Peppercorn Frame will list out that it needs 2 Cylinders, which are made in the Casting Basin and then processed in the [Steam Hammer](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/steam_hammer.md).

Continuing on with the creation of an A1 Peppercorn, we don't need another machine until we get to the point of creating the engine's firebox and boiler, using the [Boiler Roller](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/boiler_roller.md) and [Plate Rolling Machine](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/plate_rolling_machine.md).

A word of warning: Steam Engines require a constant water supply when fueled, and if they boil off 75% or more of their water, there is a chance that they will explode. As such, it's a good idea to remove any fuel from idle Steam Engines, or ensure they have a constant supply of water through a Loader and fluid piping.

Locomotives and cars can be instantly removed and picked up by using sneak and click on them.
