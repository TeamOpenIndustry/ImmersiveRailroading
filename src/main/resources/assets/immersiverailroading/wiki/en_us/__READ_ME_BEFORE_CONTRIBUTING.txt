WARNING:
'+'/'~'/'*'/'`' are reserved as formatting characters, if you want to type them as normal characters, add a '\' in front of them.
e.g.
*string* means "string" in italics, while \*string\* means "*string*".

Currently, IR's markdown system supports the following syntax:

***Bold and Italic***
**Bold**
*Italic*
++Underline++
~~Strike through~~
`Code`
[Url](a https website/an identifier pointing to a md document page)

Empty line and line break in Markdown will be directly rendered instead of ignored.

Syntax below me must be in separate line(s):

```[language specification mark like lua/json]
    Code block(use 4 spaces instead of a tab!)
```
