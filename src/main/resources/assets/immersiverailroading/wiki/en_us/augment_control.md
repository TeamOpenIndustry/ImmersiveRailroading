The Locomotive Control Augment is used to set the throttle or brake of locomotives overhead.  Right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. Like any augment, it may be removed from the track by right\-clicking with the wrench. It can be filtered by right-clicking on the augment with a locomotive item.

Right\-click on the augment with a redstone torch in your hand will switch it between a few modes:
* Throttle Forward: Sets the throttle forward proportional to the redstone signal
* Throttle Reverse: Sets the throttle reverse proportional to the redstone signal
* Brake: Sets the brake proportional to the redstone signal
* Horn: Fires off the whistle or horn regardless of redstone level
* Computer: see [Open Computers Integration](https://github.com/cam72cam/ImmersiveRailroading/wiki/Open-Computers)
