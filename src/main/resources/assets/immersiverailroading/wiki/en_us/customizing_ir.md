Immersive Railroading can be customized in a number of ways, via the config or external means:

## Config
IR has a large number of config options, the following are just some highlights.
* Acceptable fluids for Diesel Locomotive fuel
* Village payout items and the fare they pay (X blocks = 1 payout item)
* Modifiers of physical parameters of trains, including braking distancing, ease/difficulty of slopes, diesel warmup time, and steam water usage to name a few
* Cost modifiers for placing track

## External Means
Using CraftTweaker, or similar, you can modify IR even further.
* Blocks can be added to "irTie" in the OreDictionary. This allows blocks other than Treated Wood(or regular planks if Immersive Engineering is not installed) to be consumed as ties when placing track.
* Blocks can be added to "railBed" in the OreDictionary. This will add the block to the list of railbeds in the [track blueprint](immersiverailroading:wiki/en_us/track_blueprint.md).
