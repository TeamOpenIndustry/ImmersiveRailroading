The Fluid Loader/Unloader Augments are used to check what locomotive/stock is passing overhead.  Right-click on a track segment to apply the augment. Like any augment, it may be removed from the track by right-clicking with the wrench. It can be filtered by right-clicking on the augment with a locomotive or rolling stock item.

The fluid loader will accept fluid from any pipe and store it in a small internal tank that it dumps into any stock which is overhead.

The fluid unloader outputs fluid to any adjacent pipe or tank.
