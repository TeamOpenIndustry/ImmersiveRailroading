<h4 align="center">
    Immersive Railroading is a Minecraft mod for 1.16, 1.15, 1.14, 1.12, 1.11, 1.10, and 1.7.  It adds a new transport system (item and players) to the game.  It is based in real world physics (where possible) and uses life size models to convey the true scale and grandeur of Railroading.
